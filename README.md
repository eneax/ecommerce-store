A full stack application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with [React Server Components](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you must first run the [ecommerce-dashboard](https://github.com/eneax/ecommerce-dashboard) project.

Create a `.env` file in your root directory with the following environment variables from the [ecommerce-dashboard](https://github.com/eneax/ecommerce-dashboard) project:

```js
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLBOARD_ID=
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm i

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
